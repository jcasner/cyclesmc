# 3.1.6

## Upgrading

 * The use of the isDev or isTest query string parameter is now restricted to those logged in as admin,
   and requires users to login via the front end form rather than using basic authentication. This
   follows the same process as the use of the 'flush' query string parameter, and will redirect
   requests containing this argument with a token in the querystring.
   Director::isDev, Director::isTest, and Director::isLive no longer have any parameters.
